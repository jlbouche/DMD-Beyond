## Decide My Dinner!
### When you don't know what you want, let us decide for you!

We've all been there: you're with a group of friends, or at home with no desire to cook, and you're hungry. Avoid the debate and deliberation of who wants what and who "doesn't care," and use DMD!

Create a profile, save images/thoughts on your experience, and find those new restaurants!
